Compilers
=========

Shell Script Loader has also been designed so that applications that were built with it can be compiled by an external compiler to form a single file out of the many files that compose them.

A Compiler Written in Awk
-------------------------

Currently a line-based compiler that's written in GNU Awk (`gawk`) is already available. It can also be downloaded in [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loader/files/Compiler/). The compiler still has difficult limitations with imitating functions of `call()` but with common usage it should be more than enough.

There's also a plan to make a compiler in a different language or parser like Ruby or Perl but that would take time.

This is the output of `gawk -f compiler.gawk -- --help`:

```
Prototype compiler for shell scripts based on Shell Script Loader
Version: 0.1.1

Usage Summary: compiler.gawk [option [optarg] [option2] ...] file [file2 ...]

Options:

-a,  --addpath path    Add a path to the search list.
     --debug           Enable debug mode.
     --deprecated      Deprecated mode.  Parse deprecated functions instead.
-f,  --find path       Specifies the location of the 'find' utility.
                       By default, it is the output of 'which find', or simply
                       "find".  This is only useful with --extended.
-h,  --help|--usage    Show this message.
-H,  --header file     Insert a file at the top of the compiled form.  This can
                       be used to insert program description and license info.
-ia, --ignore-addpaths Ignore embedded addpath commands in scripts.
-ir, --ignore-resets   Ignore embedded reset commands in scripts.
-n,  --no-info         Do not add informative comments.
-ni, --no-indent       Do not add extra alignment indents to contents when
                       compiling.
-o,  --output file     Use file for output instead of stdout.
-O                     Optimize. (enables --strip-all-safe, and --no-info)
     --RS0             Parse commands based on RS0 (default).
     --RS0X            Parse commands based on RS0X (--extended).
     --RS0L            Parse commands based on RS0L (--deprecated).
     --RS0S            Parse commands based on RS0S (--deprecated + --extended).
     --sed             Use sed by default in some operations like stripping.
-s,  --shell path      Includes a '#!<path>' header to the output.
     --strip-bl        Strip all blank lines.
     --strip-c         Strip comments from code. (safe)
     --strip-ebl       Strip extra blank lines. (safe)
     --strip-ls        Strip leading spaces in every line of the code.
     --strip-tc        Strip trailing comments. (not really implemented yet)
     --strip-ts        Strip trailing spaces in every line of the code. (safe)
     --strip-all       Do all the strip methods mentioned above.
     --strip-all-safe  Do all the safe strip methods mentioned above.
     --tempdir path    Use a different directory for temporary files.
-x,  --extended        Parse extended functions loadx(), includex() and callx().
-V,  --version         Show version.

```

To compile a set of scripts, you simply have to use the main file as a target, and add paths where the shell scripts that would be called would be searched.

Here's an example command using the GNU Awk based compiler to compile [PlayShell](https://playshell.sourceforge.io/):

```
gawk -f loader/compiler.gawk --\
    -a ./source -s /bin/bash -H playshell.header\
    -O -o playshell source/playshell.sh

```

And this is the list of directives that the compiler recognizes:

-   `load` -- Compiler processes argument file and unconditionally includes to the compiled file.
-   `include` -- Compiler processes argument file and includes it to the compiled file if it hasn't been included yet.
-   `call` -- Compiler wraps file to a function and adds a call to that function in a subshell. The file is wrapped only once based on form of its path.
-   `loadx`, `includex`, `callx` -- Compiler does something similar to `load`, `include`, and `call` respectively, but in a multi-file manner.
-   `loader_addpath` (or `addpath` in deprecated mode) -- Compiler tries to parse the argument as a path and add it to search list.
-   `loader_flag` -- Compiler does nothing and line is not included to compiled file.
-   `loader_reset` (or `resetloader` in deprecated mode) -- Compiler does nothing and line is not included to compiled file.
-   `loader_finish` (or `finishloader` in deprecated mode) -- Compiler does nothing and line is not included to compiled file.

Since the compiler is line-based, it could only recognize directives in the scope of a line, and it cannot detect whether it is part of a comment, a multi-line string, or a here document.

To avoid lines from being unintentionally parsed, you can place directives around them. These directives look like comments, and are recognized by the compiler. It comes in pairs; one starts the beginning of the block, and the other the end of the block.

-   `#begin_skip_block` - `#end_skip_block` or\
    `#begin_compiler_skip` - `#end_compiler_skip`

    Specifies that text will not be included to the compiled file.

-   `#begin_no_parse_block` - `#end_no_parse_block` or\
    `#begin_compiler_no_parse` - `#end_compiler_no_parse`

    Specifies that text will be included but not parsed or will just be treated as plain text.

    This also prevents lines beginning with `#` from being removed when comment stripping (`--strip-c`) is enabled.

-   `#begin_no_indent_block` - `#end_no_indent_block` or\
    `#begin_compiler_no_indent` - `#end_compiler_no_indent`

    Specifies that text will not be indented when included inside call functions.

Here's an example for a script that can both be compiled and run manually:

```
#!/bin/sh

#begin_skip_block
. ./loader.sh
#end_skip_block

loader_addpath source

include some_dependency.sh  # Loads source/some_dependency.sh.
```

This one shows an example to a concept where we don't want some lines to be parsed or removed in a here document:

```
#begin_no_parse_block
cat <<EOF

Don't
load or
include anything.

# Don't remove lines
# that look like comments too.

EOF
#end_no_parse_block

```

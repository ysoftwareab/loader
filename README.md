Shell Script Loader is a framework for shell scripts that provides functions that can be used to load, include or call module shell scripts. It supports most shells including Bash, Zsh, Ksh, and other shells based on sh. A compiler can also be used. Please check the website for detailed info.

If you plan to use the extended functions, you have to get the [extended](https://github.com/ysoftwareab/loader/tree/extended) version. Original link [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loader/files/Shell%20Script%20Loader%20Extended/).

If you plan to only use the basic functions, itâ€™s recommended that you just get the [base](https://github.com/ysoftwareab/loader/tree/base) version. Original link [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loader/files/Shell%20Script%20Loader/).

If you plan to compile your scripts, you can also get the [compilers](https://github.com/ysoftwareab/loader/tree/compilers). Original link [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/loader/files/Compiler/).
